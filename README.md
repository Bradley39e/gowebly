- **htmx**: latest non-production version from CDN;
- **hyperscript**: latest non-production version from CDN;
- (_optionally_) **CSS framework**: latest non-production version from CDN;

In development mode, only official supported CDNs from developers 
will be used: 

- [unpkg.com][unpkg_url] for **htmx** and **hyperscript**;
- [tailwindcss.com][tailwindcss_cdn_url] for **Tailwind CSS**;
- [jsDelivr][jsdelivr_url] for **UnoCSS**.

Every time you make `run` command for your project:

1. CLI embed CDN versions of **htmx** and **hyperscript** from the
   official (and trusted) resources to your Go HTML templates in a regular 
   `<script>` tag into the block called `gowebly-body-scripts` (usually, 
   placed on the bottom of the `<body>` tag);
2. (_optionally_) CLI embed a CDN version of the chosen **CSS framework** 
   from the official (and trusted) resource to your Go HTML templates in a 
   regular `<link>` tag into the block called `gowebly-head-styles` (usually,

3. CLI start a project's backend (on the port `5000`) via simple `go run` 
   command.

deploy.

```console

- (_optionally_) **CSS framework**: latest production tree-shaking & 
  minified version;

Every time you make `build` command for your project:

1. CLI scan and validate the YAML config file (`.gowebly.yml`), apply all 
   settings to the current project;
2. CLI download minified versions of **htmx** and **hyperscript** from the 
   official (and trusted) resources;
   - Embed them into your Go HTML templates (inline-style) to the block 
     called `gowebly-body-scripts` (usually, placed on the bottom of the 
     `<body>` tag);
3. (_optionally_) CLI prepare a minified (and tree-shaking) version of the 
   chosen **CSS framework** via [Vite][vite_url] tool;
   - Embed them into your Go HTML templates (inline-style) to the block 
     called `gowebly-head-styles` (usually, placed on the bottom of the 
     `<head>` tag);
4. CLI generate a clear and well-documented `docker-compose.yml` file in the 
   root of the project folder for deploy it in isolated Docker containers 
   via [Portainer][portainer_url] (_recommended_) or manually to your remote 
   server.
